# seedling life

 An early-stage project, **seedling life* aims to develop patterns and tools to help instutions evolve rapidly to tackle the sustainability crises.

## Who?

For anybody who feels institutions can and should be better.

For anybody disappointed in their company, government or association.

For those who have experienced any of the following in their institution:
  - Values and practices are not aligned with purpose and goals
  - Trying to make a difference causes demotivation and/or burnout
  - Tools for solving our problems are there but people don't use them

## Why?

The core hypothesis behind this project is the **institution dead-end hypothesis**:
  1. Achieving sustainability requires a radical, rapid and global cultural shift
  2. Our cultural patterns are mediated by communities, which are shaped by institutions
  3. Context, history, regulation and vested interests make institutions hard to change
  
Existing patterns and tools don't focus this root cause, but on its symptoms. The **seedling life** project is focused exclusively on solving this problem.

It strives to **help institutions evolve rapidly** which we hope would enable:
  - Radical advances in cultural diversity and adaptibility
  - Low-friction cocreation of community-driven institutions
  - Accelerated progress in tackling sustainability challenges
  
## How?
 
By **simplifying institutions**:
  1. easily start and run ethical legal institutions
  2. rapidly adopt and share sustainable cultural patterns
  3. transparently align community, values and practice
  
## What?
  
We want to build **seedling kernel** and open and decentralized institutional framework. 
 
The framework would consist of a set of loosely coupled but highly synergetic elements:

  1. **core** - pragmatic conceptual framework
  2. **platform** - federated modern app framework
  3. **institution** - legally accountable org framework
  4. **design** - parametric visual design framework
  5. **movement** - collective somatic framework
